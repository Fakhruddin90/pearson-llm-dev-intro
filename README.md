# LLMs, GPT, and Prompt Engineering for Developers

This repository contains code for the [O'Reilly Live Online Training for LLMs, GPT, and Prompt Engineering for Developers](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-events/-/0636920094338)

Dive into the fascinating world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) in this comprehensive live online course. Throughout four engaging hours, you'll learn the essentials of LLMs, GPT, and language modeling while exploring practical applications through prompt engineering. This course is perfect for programmers and software engineers interested in the cutting-edge technology that powers modern AI language understanding and generation.

This course is the first in a three-part series by Sinan Ozdemir designed for machine learning engineers and software developers who want to expand their skillset and learn how to work with LLMs like ChatGPT and FLAN-T5. The series provides practical instruction on prompt engineering, language modeling, moving LLM prototypes to production, and fine-tuning GPT models. The three live courses in the series are:

LLMs, GPT and Prompt Engineering for Developers
Using Open- and Closed-Source LLMs in Real World Applications
LLMs from Prototypes to Production
The book Quick Start Guide to LLMs by Sinan Ozdemir is recommended as companion material for post-class reference.
